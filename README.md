# Android-App
This is my Covid-19 Application which allows the user to input data relating to cases and suspectedcases of the novel coronavirus in Ireland. It supports CRUD so the user can Create cases, read cases, update and delete cases. It also supports persistence via JSON so that all data in the app is stored in a .JSON file on the phone
